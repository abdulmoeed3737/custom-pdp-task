```
{%- for option in item.options_with_values -%}
  {% unless option.name == 'Fabric Panel' %}
  <div class="product-option">
    <dt>{{ option.name }}:</dt>
    <dd>{{ option.value }}</dd>
  </div>
  {% endunless %}
{%- endfor -%}
```


## Pricing Logic ðŸ’°

The price calculation is based on the metafields price_mappings and fabric_panel_count. The logic follows these steps:

When a user selects a particular width it retrieve the corresponding fabric panel count from metafield and check drop length.

Check the price_mappings metafield for a key matching {fabric_panel}/{drop}.

Retrieve the price value from the metafield and update the product price dynamically.


## Example Calculation:

If a customer selects Width: 150 cm and Drop: 400 cm, first it gets the corresponding fabric panel count from the metfield which is 3 and then calculates the corresponding metafield key as 3/400, which maps to 4000 in price mapping metafield.

The product price is then updated in add to cart button with necessary currency.

It then also updates the variant id so that the selected variant is added to cart.

The values of fabric, color, width, chain side, chain colour and installation height are added as product properties.
